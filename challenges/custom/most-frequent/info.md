# Most Frequently Occuring Item in Array

Given an array of **integers**, find the integers that occurs the most in the **array**.
Ex: `[1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1]` -> Ans: `1`

If you're given an empty array, you should return `null`.

You can assume that there is *always a single*, *unique value* that appears most frequently *unless the array is empty*.

For instance, you won't be given an array such as `[1, 1, 2, 2]`.
